                        These Rules and Regulations ("<b>Rules</b>") are part of the Site's{" "}

                    <p>
                        The Rules apply to all bets placed on this online betting platform ("
                        <b>Site</b>"). The Rules consist of the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This INTRODUCTION section (Part A);</li>
                        <li>The GENERAL RULES (set out in Part B below); and</li>
                        <li>
                            The SPECIFIC SPORTS RULES (set out in Part C below - these apply to
                            certain sports).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The General Rules apply to all bets unless stated otherwise in the
                        Specific Sports Rules. If there is any inconsistency between the Specific
                        Sports Rules and the General Rules, the Specific Sports Rules shall
                        prevail.

                    <p>
                        The rules governing how markets are offered, managed and/or settled are
                        not the same for every market on each product. In certain circumstances, a
                        bet that is settled as a winner on one product may be settled as a loser
                        on the other product (and vice versa). Additionally, different settlement
                        rules may apply so that, for example, bets that are a winner on one
                        product may be settled as a dead heat or be voided on the other product.
                        Customers must ensure that they familiarise themselves with the relevant
                        rules that apply to the bets that they place on the Site.

                        immediately. If the customer continues to place a bet in these
                        circumstances, they shall take reasonable action to minimise any potential
                        loss. In the absence of such action, the Site reserves the right to void a
                        bet.

                            Markets will be settled in accordance as set out in the Specific Sports
                            Rules.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Where the Specific Sports Rules do not specify how and on what basis a
                            market will be settled, markets will be settled on the official result
                            of the relevant governing body regardless of any subsequent
                            disqualification or amendment to the result (except if an amendment is
                            announced within 24 hours of the initial settlement of the relevant
                            market in order to correct an error in reporting the result).

                            If no official result of a relevant governing body is available, the
                            result will be determined by the Site (acting reasonably) using
                            information from independent sources. In such cases, if any new
                            information comes into the public domain within 48 hours of settlement,
                            then the Site shall (acting reasonably) determine either: (i) whether
                            the market should be reinstated or resettled in light of this new
                            information; or (ii) whether or not to wait for further information
                            before deciding whether to reinstate or resettle the market. Except
                            where the Site has announced that it is waiting for further information,
                            any information that comes into the public domain more than 48 hours
                            after a market has been settled shall not be considered by the Site
                            (regardless of whether or not such information may have led to a
                            different result).

                            unlimited period until the uncertainty can be resolved to the reasonable
                            satisfaction of the Site. The Site reserves the right to void any market
                            if the uncertainty regarding settlement cannot be resolved to the Site's
                            reasonable satisfaction.

                        <li>
                            Markets are generally settled shortly after the end of the event in
                            question. the Site may settle (or part-settle) some markets before the
                            official result is declared (or may increase a customer's 'available to
                            bet' balance by the minimum potential winnings of that customer on a
                            given market) purely as a customer service benefit. However, the Site
                            reserves the right to amend the settlement of the market if: (i) the
                            official result is different to the result on which the Site initially
                            settled the market; or (ii) if the whole market is eventually voided
                            (e.g. for an abandoned event).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The Site reserves the right to reverse the settlement of a market if a
                            market is settled in error (for example, a human or technical error).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If The Site resettles a market, this may lead to amendments being made
                            to a customer's balance to reflect changes in market settlement.

                            Subject always to the Site's right to void bets under its terms and
                            conditions or for any exception under the Rules, if a market contains a
                            statement that says "All bets stand, run or not" (or something similar),
                            then all bets on a team or competitor will stand regardless of whether
                            or not the team or competitor starts the event or takes any part in the
                            event.

                        <li>
                            If a team or competitor is disqualified, withdraws or forfeits after
                            starting an event they will be deemed a loser providing at least one
                            other team or competitor completes the event. If no team or competitor
                            completes an event (having started) then all bets will be void except
                            for bets on any markets which have been unconditionally determined.

                            participation of a particular competitor. If the competitor named in a
                            'Winner with …' market title does not participate in the tournament or
                            event then all bets on the market will be void.

                        <li>
                            A team or competitor will be deemed to have participated if they have
                            taken part to the extent necessary to record an official result or
                            classification (including any disqualification but excluding any "did

                    <p>
                        Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific
                        Sports Rules. However, where a market has no rules in the Specific Sports
                        Rules in relation to an abandonment, cancellation and/or postponement the
                        following shall apply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In relation to any match, fixture, game, individual event, or similar: If
                        the event is not completed within three days after the scheduled
                        completion date, then all bets on markets for this event will be void,
                        except for bets on any markets that have been unconditionally determined.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In relation to any tournament, competition or similar: If the event is not
                        completed within three days after the scheduled completion date, then any
                        markets relating to the event will be settled in accordance with the
                        official ruling of the relevant governing body, providing such a decision
                        is given within 90 days after the scheduled completion date. If no
                        official ruling is announced in this 90 day period, then bets on any
                        market relating to this event will be void, except for bets on any markets
                        which have been unconditionally determined. If a market is to be voided
                        but has been part-settled as a courtesy to customers, then such
                        part-settled bets will be reversed and all bets on the market will be
                        void.

                    <p>
                        The Site will decide (acting reasonably) whether a market relates to a
                        match (or similar) or a tournament (or similar).

                    <h3>Change of venue</h3>
                    <p>
                        Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific
                        Sports Rules.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, if change of venue is not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules
                        then the following shall apply:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            For any team sport: if the scheduled venue is changed after the market
                            is loaded by the Site, all bets will be void only if the new venue is a
                            home ground of the original away team
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For all categories or markets other than team sports: if the scheduled
                            venue is changed after the market is loaded by the Site, all bets will
                            stand.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If there is a change in the type of scheduled surface after the market
                            has been loaded, all bets will stand.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Periods of time</h3>
                    <p>
                        Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific
                        Sports Rules. However, if not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules then
                        the following shall apply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the scheduled duration of an event is changed after the market has been
                        loaded but before the start of the event, then all bets will be void.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some markets refer to the length of time until an occurrence in the event
                        (e.g. time of first goal). If an event happens in stoppage or injury time
                        after any regular time period then it will be deemed to have occurred at
                        the end of the regular time period. For example, if a goal is scored in
                        first half stoppage-time in a soccer match it will be deemed to have
                        occurred on 45 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All bets apply to the relevant full 'regular time' period including
                        stoppage time. Any extra-time and/or penalty shoot-out is not included.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        References within these Rules to a particular number of 'days' shall mean
                        the end of the day local time after the expiry of the specified number of
                        days.

                    <p>
                        Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific
                        Sports Rules. However, if not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules then
                        the following shall apply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any 'to qualify' market (e.g. "to reach the final" markets) will be
                        determined by the competitor or team that qualifies, whether or not they
                        take part in the next round or event for which they have qualified.
                        Markets will be settled after the qualifying stage and any subsequent
                        disqualification or amendment to the result will not count.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Unless stated otherwise in the Specific Sports Rules the Dead Heat Rule
                        applies to bets on a market where there are more winners than expected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For each bet matched on a relevant winning selection, the stake money is
                        first reduced in proportion by multiplying it by the sum of the number of
                        winners expected, divided by the number of actual winners (i.e. stake
                        multiplied by (number of winners expected/number of actual winners)). The
                        winnings are then paid to the successful backers on this 'reduced stake'
                        (reduced stake multiplied by traded price) and the remaining stake money
                        is paid to the appropriate layers.

                            Running Ball (in-play) bets may be kept in 'pending' mode during
                            'high-risk' moments in a match, as defined by the Operator. Bets in
                            pending mode on markets relating to goals (including Handicap and Over/
                            Under) may be accepted only if and when a 'high-risk' moment does not
                            result in a goal being scored or red card being issued. Bets in pending
                            mode on markets relating to corners or cards may be accepted only if and
                            when a 'high-risk' moment does not result in a corner being taken or
                            card being issued. Even when a 'high-risk' moment does not result in a
                            goal being scored, corner being taken or card being issued, the Operator
                            reserves the right not to accept any bet being kept in pending mode. Bet
                            placed while in pending will be accepted when the 'high-risk' element
                            has passed. This includes bets that has been placed prior to the final
                            whistle but still in danger until the final whistle has been blown.

                        <li>
                            The Site's non-runner rule relates to the adjustment of odds on bets
                            already matched when a horse in a race is declared a non-runner. In
                            order to make the adjustment the Site applies a reduction factor to the
                            remaining runners. The reduction factor allocated to a non-runner is a
                            calculation (the details of which are described below) of that horse's
                            chances of winning (or being placed, etc as appropriate) and is applied
                            to bets already matched on the other runners in the relevant market or
                            markets.

                        <li>
                            Any horse listed when the relevant market is loaded which does not
                            subsequently come under starter's orders is deemed to be a non-runner.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When the market is loaded each horse is given a 'reduction factor',
                            based on a forecast price, which is expressed as a percentage. These
                            reduction factors may be updated periodically at the discretion of the
                            Site based on trading in the market, but after approximately 15 minutes
                            (approximately 5 minutes for Australian and US markets) from the
                            scheduled 'off' time of a given race, they will be updated only in
                            exceptional circumstances. The current reduction factor percentage for
                            each horse can be viewed on the 'info' page on the Site website or by
                            asking the Helpdesk.

                            differently (as described below), and horses will have a different

                                    non-runner's final reduction factor and all the unmatched offers to
                                    lay will be cancelled. If the non-runner's reduction factor is less

                            material runner (i.e. a selection with a reduction factor of approx.
                            2.5% or less in the win market). In such circumstances, all pre-play
                            unmatched and matched bets will stand, however if the runner is not
                            introduced before the start of the race, all in-play bets will be void.
                            However, if the missing runner is deemed to be a material runner, then
                            the malformed market will be void and a new market will be loaded where

                            <br />
                            For example, when beting on Natus Vincere (R04, Full Buy) vs Virtus Pro
                            (R04, Full Buy) you are betting on which team will win the fourth round.
                            However, all bets on the round will be cancelled if one of the two team
                            does not make a “Full Buy”.

                            <b>Match-ups:</b> Bets will be void if both golfers do not tee off. If

                            what happens after the cut. If both miss the cut, the lower scorer after

                    <p>
                        If a match is decided by a super over then the result of the super over
                        will determine the winner for betting purposes. Where there is a tie (as
                        determined by the official governing body) bets will be settled according
                        to the official match result determining the winning side/side to
                        progress. In matches abandoned, decided by a coin toss or a bowl out all
                        bets will be void. In matches abandoned due to outside interference, all
                        bets will be void unless the official competition rules determine a
                        winner. All bets will be void if canceled matches are not replayed within
                        48 hours of the originally scheduled start time. If there is a change of
                        teams from originally advertised, then all bets will be void.

                    <p>
                        For limited overs matches, bets will be void if it has not been possible
                        to complete at least 80% of the overs scheduled to be bowled in either
                        innings due to external factors unless settlement of the bet has already
                        been determined. In first-class matches that result in a draw, bets will
                        be void if fewer than 200 overs have been bowled unless settlement of the
                        bet has already been determined. Only fours/sixes scored from the bat will
                        count towards the total fours/sixes. Overthrows, all-run fours, and extras
                        do not count. Fours/sixes scored in a super over do not count. In First
                        Class games and Test Matches, only the first innings’ fours/sixes will
                        count. If there is no more play after the bet is struck then bets are
                        void.

                        Bets will be settled on the score at the fall of the first wicket for each
                        side regardless of any players retiring hurt. For settlement purposes, a
                        batsman retiring hurt does not count as a wicket. If a side does not lose
                        a wicket by the end of their allotted overs then their final score will be
                        taken for settlement purposes. If there is no more play after a bet is
                        struck then that bet will be void. In the event of a tie, where the market
                        is offered as a two-way option only, bets will be void.

                        Both sides must bowl their first over in its entirety unless a settlement
                        has already been determined. For limited overs matches if the second
                        innings is shortened by more than 20% of the scheduled overs for any
                        reason after the first over of the first innings has been bowled then bets
                        will be void. In First class or Test matches the first over of the first
                        innings only counts for settlement purposes. The score at the end of the
                        over will be taken including extras and penalty runs. In the event of a
                        tie, where the market is offered as a two-way option only, bets will be
                        void.

                        Both sides must bowl the relevant number of overs in their entirety unless
                        a settlement has already been determined. For limited overs matches if the
                        second innings is shortened by more than 20% of the scheduled overs for
                        any reason after the named session of the first innings has been bowled
                        then bets will be void. In first-class or Test matches the first session
                        of the first innings only counts for settlement purposes. The score at the
                        end of the over will be taken including extras and penalty runs.

                        legal balls. Should a wide be bowled, then followed by a four, this will
                        be two separate delivery markets, the first being resulted as 1 and the

                        Therefore, an over with 2 wides will have 8 de-liveries as opposed to 6
                        legal balls. Should a wide be bowled, then followed by a four, this will
                        be two separate delivery markets, the first being resulted as 1 and the

                        The Over in its entirety must be bowled unless the batting team is All

                        this market is already determined. Extras and Penalty Runs will count only
                        where they are accredited to a particular delivery within that Over.

                        settlement is already determined, or bets will be void. If the Innings
                        reaches a natural conclusion within the specified number of Overs (the
                        team is all out or the target is reached) then bets will stand and settled
                        at the final Innings score. Extras and Penalty runs accrued will be
                        included in the final total for settlement purposes if officially
                        attributed to the total at the time, but not if added retrospectively. In
                        the event of an abandoned match bets will be void unless a settlement has
                        already been determined.

                    <h4>Fall of Wicket</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Team score at the fall of the named wicket will be taken for
                        settlement purposes. If a batsman retires hurt and is replaced by a
                        different player, this will not count as a wicket and the market will not
                        be settled until a wicket has fallen. If the Innings reaches a natural
                        conclusion (Declaration or reaches target) then the final Innings score
                        will be deemed the result for settlement purposes, but it must be possible
                        for the team to have surpassed quotes traded on or these bets will be
                        void. Any bets placed where no further play takes place after the
                        placement of that bet, for whatever reason, shall be void. If an Innings
                        is curtailed due to the intervention of rain, then bets placed before the
                        curtailment shall be settled if already determined (the total has been
                        passed already) or voided if not already determined, should there be no
                        further play. Extras and Penalty Runs will be included. In the event of an
                        abandoned match bets will be void unless a settlement has already been
                        determined.

                    <p>
                        Methods of dismissal only include: Bowled, Caught, LBW, Run Out, Stumped,
                        Obstructing the Field, Hit the Ball Twice, Hit Wicket, and Timed Out. If a
                        batsman retires this does not count as a dismissal for settlement
                        purposes. The market will be settled on the dismissal method for the
                        specified wicket number, regardless of whether the players are different
                        due to retirements or otherwise. If the Innings ends with the named wicket
                        not falling, then all bets will be void.

                    <p>
                        For limited overs matches bets will be void if the innings is reduced by
                        more than 20% from the scheduled overs at the time of the bet being
                        struck, unless settlement is already determined. Any bets placed where no
                        further play takes place after the placement of that bet, for whatever
                        reason, shall be void. If the batsman retires hurt and does not return to
                        the crease, the market will be settled with the players' score at the time
                        of their retirement. Should the player return to the crease, any
                        additional runs scored will be added to their score for settlement
                        purposes. If in the event of a player is replaced by a concussion
                        substitute, that player's market will be settled at their final score if
                        they have batted and Voided if they have not batted, and a new market will
                        be created for the replacement player. Any bets placed after the batsman
                        has faced their final ball will be void. InPlay a batsman must be at the
                        crease when a ball is bowled for bets to stand. Pre-match bets will stand
                        regardless of whether the batsman is at the crease when a ball is bowled,
                        as long as the team had the opportunity to face at least 80% of the
                        allocated overs at the time the bet was struck.
